        I have experience developing web applications, from simple landing pages
        to progressive web applications. I strive to create software that not
        only functions efficiently under the hood, but also provides intuitive,
        pixel-perfect user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love learning new and better ways to create seamless user experiences
        with clean, efficient and scalable code. I consider work an ongoing
        education, and I am always looking for opportunities to work with those
        who are willing to share their knowledge as much as I want to learn. At
        the end of the day, my primary goal is to create something beautiful
        with people that bring out the best in me.
